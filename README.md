# mt32.net - Frontend

This is a frontend web application build with Vue.js to run as a web site. The goal of this project is to create a nice looking, efficient, flexible and intuitive interface, with its help it's easy to present helpful and interesting content. 

## About

Please note that this is just the frontend. This piece of software will only display content it gets via a specified [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API.

This website is written out of personal need, but feel free to use it yourself or fork it, as long as you give credit.

## API and backend

### The GraphQL API

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an alternative to the common RESTful APIs. The big difference is: You get what you want, nothing more and nothing less. Because of these great advantage and some other cool stuff you can do with GraphQL I decided to choose it over REST.

## How to use?

You have to decide for a backend, that features a GraphQL API. But you can/must also change the code to make it compatible.
